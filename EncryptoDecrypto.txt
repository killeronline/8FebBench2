We need to get a timestamp from server on home screen
$t=time(); assume this is var t1 = 34553130
now we map this t1 to a datetime on client c1 = 08022016122133 (or client epoch)
when timerequest is sent
in future we will have a datetime on client c2 = 08022016122550
game start at 21 : 33 , some web request sent at 25 : 50 
so time diff is 4 mins and 17 seconds
t1 - c1 = constant = t2 - c2
t1 - c1 = t2 - c2
Find t2 ?
t2 = t1 - c1 + c2
t2 = t1 + ( c2 - c1 )
which here would be t2 = 34553130 + ( offset = commonsence of time diff ) 
t2 = 34553130 + ( 4mins 17 seconds ) = 34553130 + 257seconds = 34553387
t2 is sent to server along with the Encrypted Get Request
....

Why ?

assume hacker uses fiddler/wireshark to see http requests
he can see a request of adding 100 Gems as rewards like 

mrwdata.website / gems.php ? request = t7yUh635Jikjuf31hjuPoLvbEwMj

[Hack] : now he may note it down and hit it when ever he needs to get 100 Gems

the request can be like coin increment or unit upgrade...

sometimes his direct calling of our webrequest may create bad data in our database

.........

How we avoid this ?

We make use of t2 and see that if the request is sent from game or any other

because only our game has the ability to send the perfect offset as it gets the t1 from server and calculates t2

so if hacker should note the request and hit it again, Encryption fails as it is time bound to server and client

.........

challenges ?

due to network latency we cannot deliver a request in the next second to server
it may take upto 30seconds to 1minute or 2minutes.
so by analytics and testing we will find a comfortable window like 2 minutes

so even if hacker can hack the request but cannot use it for other players as it is encrypted

also he may use a gem increment but then he may use it for only 2 minutes
.........

hard part ?

encrypting all the request into single unified encrypted request
also we need to decrypt the request at the server in php code
finally we need to encrypt the output in php code
and also decrypt the output in our game
..........
